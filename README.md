# Analytical Solution for Heterogeneous Leaky Aquifers

This repository provides the Python implementation and validation scripts for the analytical model presented in my paper: Analytical Solution for Steady-State Flow in Heterogeneous Leaky Aquifers: Verification Against MODFLOW 6, by M. Hayek.

## Contents
- `analsol.py`: Implements the analytical solution for steady-state flow in heterogeneous leaky aquifers.
- `mf6_vs_anal.ipynb`: Compares the analytical results with MODFLOW 6 simulations.

## Usage
Run `mf6_vs_anal.ipynb` to reproduce the comparison figures and results.

## Reference
Please cite the associated paper when using this code.
